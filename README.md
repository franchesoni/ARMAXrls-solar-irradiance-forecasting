# ARMAXrls-solar-irradiance-forecasting
We implement an ARMAX algorithm in a Recursive Least Squares fashion to forecast solar irradiance

* Use save_matrices to convert the raw data to numpy arrays
* Use get_errors to run evaluate and persistence functions.
* Use tocsv to convert results to .csv files as in les.edu.uy
